@workspace I want you to create a chatbot for the incoming students which can answer all their questions, i want you first to generate the folder structure for my project .
I want to have a frontend done with javascript and a backend done in fast api.
i will have a vector database aswell for storing the embedded questions and answers.
The goal is to create a RAG system which is able to answer the user queries based on the knowledge base availbale. the framework has to be langchain and langgraph.
At first i need you to provide me a easy and comprehensive folder structure where the frontend and backend are properly isolated. follow the best practices of application development. I'm  using poetry for dependencies managment.
Don't provide any code yet just the structure and then wait for my input for the next step.
Keep in mind this is the fist time for me doing this kind of project.
