I created a complete AI chatbot for NJCU’s Center for Career and Professional Development from scratch. I started by gathering the center’s key information into a 
structured Excel file, then converted it into a CSV file to feed the chatbot’s knowledge base. Using Python (FastAPI) for the backend, I built the system that 
processes questions and retrieves accurate answers. The frontend, designed in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, provides an easy-to-use chat interface with NJCU branding. 
I connected everything through GitHub for version control and deployed it on Render, so the chatbot is accessible online to students and staff.
