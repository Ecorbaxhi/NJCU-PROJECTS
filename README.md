CHATBOT CONSTRUCTION

During the work as a Graduate Assistant Data Scientist for the NJCU university I am working on different projects. The first one is the creation of a Chatbot where I was addressing the problem many students have related to first questions and information related to the carrer office. 

This is a ready-to-adapt starter pack for a simple chatbot that answers studentsâ€™ basic questions about your Career & Professional Development office (CPD). It uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) instead of "training" the LLM, so you can update answers by editing your FAQs and documents.
